Feature: Private getaways

  Scenario: Four Seasons Private Retreats
    Given I want a quick getaway, I navigate to the four seasons website
    When I get to the homepage, I see private retreats
    And I like the sound of this so I click the link
    When I navigate to the private retreats page I scroll down
    And I start browsing the page and notice one-of-a-kind experience
    Then I begin scroll right/left to view some of the pictures

    Given I've had enough of looking at the pictures
    And I now want to book my vacation
    And I select the beach & seaside style
    And I begin to browse the page
    When I notice Indonesia I select it's property details
    And I also notice Thailand so I select it's property details
    And I also notice Vietnam so I select it's property details
    Then I look at all my options and close my broswer
